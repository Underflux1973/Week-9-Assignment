REFLECTIONS:

My refelctions this week are slightly limited at I was ill from Friday afternoon all the way through to Monday so I have not been able to spend any where near the amount of time that I would have liked on this. I was actually feeling a bit more confident in the use of the Next JS and building on last weeks project and progress made there I feel that I would have gotten fairly close to an MVP. Once the course has finished I am going to return to these unfinshed projects including this one, and complete them.

I haven't spent any extra time on this project throughout the week as I have been committed to completing the Week 10 assignment so I will understand completely if the marks are low or even, none existant.

Plan the wireframe - i need to work out what pages i need.

- concept and problem domain
- Wireframe
- Database schema - i need at least 2 tables (users and posts -for example)
- one to many relationship - one user to many posts
- the foreign key should always be in the many table (e.g posts) - your foreign key IN THE MANY TABLE should reference the clerk_column there needs to be a SERIAL PRIMARY KEY id and the CLERK REFERENCE ID COLUMN
- as part of the sign up process in clerk we will need to set a db query to insert a new users data into the users table. this will be coded on the sign up page

Two options - SET UP APP - e.g. how many pages and routes do i need or SET UP CLERK
